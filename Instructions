First, create a folder on your computer that you can put all of the files in
This should include our code (escape.exe.py) along with the 4 images (2 png images and 2 gifs)
You will also need to download the necessary python modules: time, tkinter, turtle, and pillow.
Once everything is in the same folder, click on the code and run
Enjoy!
