Creation of 400 Meter Dash Turtle Game by Ryan Vansluytman
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
This was hands down the most difficult project I ever worked on. I will even take it a step further and say the most challenging project. I have never 
put so much time, effort, and heart into a project before. I learned so much from developing this game with my peers. I wanted to ensure this project 
was a true reflection of my passion to learning the necessary skills to become an ethical hacker. This is my first semesterlearning about anything 
programming related, so it was definitely a challenge. Some challenges I had to overcome was learning the different python modules such as 'time', 
'tkinter', and 'pillow'. I spent so much time educating myself and gathering resources and effectively communicating with my team to ensure we were all 
on the same page and we all put our creative minds together. Learning tkinter was very challenging for me and time consuming, but it was definitely 
worthwhile. I am now aware of more capabilites of python. I definitely feel the progress I have made knowledge-wise from creating this game. I never knew 
the turtle module could be shown on a GUI and that was what tripped me up so much. I also had to struggle to learn how to place a background image on a 
tkinter canvas. I really loved seeing the end product and knowing that our time and hard work all paid off when we were able to be game developers!
