Creation of Story Line and Hangman by Anthony Febbraro
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
In the beginning of this project, we all had big ideas and high aspirations for what we wanted the final product to look like. After initial brainstorming, we each decided that we would work on different puzzles that would be included in the overall game. I was assigned to work on hangman. This initially took a lot of trial and error with certain functions that included reading a file of words and creating a blank spot for the user to guess each letter. The rest was pretty simple, creating functions that were based on user input. Since I was done early, I decided to take on writing the storyline. I was very passionate about this part of the project because I really enjoy creative writing, so I was excited to implement my own storyline into a game. Also, having a huge passion for escape rooms definitely helped with this. I wanted to create an eerie feel to the game which also kept the player interested in what they were reading. Lastly, I decided to create one more game, which is the first game in the puzzle, that prompts the user to find a key to escape the first room. This wasnâ€™t that difficult because it just involved user input and showing functions along with a randomness aspect for where the key would go. The only struggle was creating small images to go with each location because I am not particularly gifted in the keyboard art department. 
I would say that the biggest challenge was incorporating each of our puzzles together in the game and getting the game to flow, because we all had to put trust in each other that each part of the game was complete and working well. Also, we had to ditch the idea of making it super interactive and rely more on the story line because including a lot of choices regarding direction and flow of the game definitely would have taken us at least another 2 weeks. This game is something that we are super proud about and we may even further develop it over the summer to enhance our skills even more. Thanks for playing! (AJ Febbraro)



Creation of 400 Meter Dash Turtle Game by Ryan Vansluytman
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
This was hands down the most difficult project I ever worked on. I will even take it a step further and say the most challenging project. I have never 
put so much time, effort, and heart into a project before. I learned so much from developing this game with my peers. I wanted to ensure this project 
was a true reflection of my passion to learning the necessary skills to become an ethical hacker. This is my first semesterlearning about anything 
programming related, so it was definitely a challenge. Some challenges I had to overcome was learning the different python modules such as 'time', 
'tkinter', and 'pillow'. I spent so much time educating myself and gathering resources and effectively communicating with my team to ensure we were all 
on the same page and we all put our creative minds together. Learning tkinter was very challenging for me and time consuming, but it was definitely 
worthwhile. I am now aware of more capabilites of python. I definitely feel the progress I have made knowledge-wise from creating this game. I never knew 
the turtle module could be shown on a GUI and that was what tripped me up so much. I also had to struggle to learn how to place a background image on a 
tkinter canvas. I really loved seeing the end product and knowing that our time and hard work all paid off when we were able to be game developers!
